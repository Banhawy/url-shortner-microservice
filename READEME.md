# URL Shortener Microservice
This is part of FCC [API Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice), where the goal is to a web API that a user can use to shorten any url. The api is called by pointing a client to:
```
https://adham-url-shortner-ms.herokuapp.com/new/[URL-to-be-shortened]
```
This will return a json response with a new alias URL that will redirect to the user's initial URL.
